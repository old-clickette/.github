# Clickette
Looking to escape the trackers? Clickette is your #1 solution to stay private online.
## A little about us.
Clickette is the worlds best privacy search engine, that aims to keep our users fully protected.
We never store ANY user data, and never will. On Clickette, there are 0 logs of website visits or searches, and we aim to keep it that way.
## Why switch?
- **Google Search tracks you, Clickette doesn't.**
On Clickette, there are no search histories and no user profiling. This means your search activity remains private.
- **“Incognito Mode” isn't private.**
Google wants you to think “Incognito Mode” is private. It's not. Google still tracks every search you make and most websites you visit in Incognito Mode. Clickette doesn't track you, ever.
